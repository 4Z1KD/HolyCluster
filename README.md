# HolyCluster 🌐
This is an ongoing effort to create a visualization to ham radio cluster<br>
<br>
# Installation 🛠
1. create virtual environment (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) ☁️<br>
   python -m venv venv_HolyCluster<br>
3. activate the venv (Scripts\activate.bat) 🌬️
4. copy this project's files to the venv directory 📑
5. install the requirements (pip install -r requirements.txt) 🧰

in the future it will be compiled into an executable 💾<br>
